# Installer Update Summary

## Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: "Neulbom cannot be closed. Please close it manually and click Retry to continue."
- **Root Cause**: The NSIS installer script was using nsProcess plugin which may not be available on all systems.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the NSIS installer script (`scripts/installer.nsh`) to use built-in Windows commands instead of external plugins:

### Key Changes:
1. **Replaced nsProcess plugin with taskkill commands**:
   - Uses `tasklist` to check if Neulbom.exe is running
   - Uses `taskkill` to gracefully close the app
   - Falls back to force close (`taskkill /F`) if graceful shutdown fails
   - Only shows manual close dialog if all automatic methods fail

2. **Improved Process Detection**:
   - Checks for both `Neulbom.exe` and `jump_server.exe` processes
   - Provides detailed output messages during installation
   - Includes 2-second wait periods for processes to fully terminate

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Multiple fallback methods for closing processes
   - Clear user feedback during the process
   - Graceful degradation to manual close if needed

## Files Updated:
- `scripts/installer.nsh` - Updated NSIS script with standard Windows commands
- Generated new installer files:
  - `dist/Neulbom-Setup-1.0.0.exe` (universal)
  - `dist/Neulbom-Setup-1.0.0-x64.exe` (64-bit)
  - `dist/Neulbom-Setup-1.0.0-ia32.exe` (32-bit)

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test the installer when Neulbom is running
2. Verify that the installer automatically closes the app
3. Check that the app starts correctly after installation
4. Confirm camera/microphone permissions work immediately

## Build Command:
```bash
npm run build:win
```

## Next Steps:
The installer should now handle running processes automatically without requiring manual intervention. The koala animation and camera/microphone features should work immediately after installation.
