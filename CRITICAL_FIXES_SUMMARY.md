# Critical Fixes Summary

## 🔥 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Mac Speech Recognition Issue**
- **Problem**: "고맙습니다" fallback responses from unclear audio
- **Root Cause**: Poor audio quality and very short recordings
- **Solution**: 
  - Minimum 1-second recording time
  - Optimized audio settings (16kHz, noise suppression)
  - Better error messages

### 2. **Windows Game Page AI Backend Issue**
- **Problem**: AI not responding on game pages
- **Root Cause**: Missing speech-to-text endpoint for non-Electron contexts
- **Solution**:
  - Added `/speech-to-text` endpoint to Flask server
  - Complete AI system message in shared-mic.js
  - Dual fallback system (IPC → HTTP)

## 🧪 Testing Protocol

### For Mac Users:
1. Build the app and test main page first
2. Hold M key for **at least 1-2 seconds** (not just a quick press)
3. Speak clearly and close to microphone
4. Should see progression: "녹음 중" → "음성 인식 중" → "AI 응답 생성 중" → "완료"
5. Test on game pages - same behavior expected

### For Windows Users:
1. Run executable and ensure Flask server starts
2. Test main page microphone functionality
3. Navigate to any game page (369, 스무고개, etc.)
4. Test M-key functionality - should work identically
5. AI should respond with full game knowledge

## 📋 Expected Improvements:

### Mac Builds:
- ✅ No more "고맙습니다" fallback messages
- ✅ Better audio recognition accuracy
- ✅ Clear error messages for audio issues
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all pages

### Windows Builds:
- ✅ AI backend works on all game pages
- ✅ Full game rule knowledge available everywhere
- ✅ Fallback to HTTP when Electron IPC unavailable
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## 🔍 Debugging Tips:

If issues persist:
1. **Check console logs** (F12) for detailed error messages
2. **Verify Flask server** is running on port 5001
3. **Test audio permissions** - ensure microphone access granted
4. **Check recording time** - hold M key for at least 1-2 seconds
5. **Audio quality** - speak clearly, reduce background noise

The fixes address both the Mac speech recognition fallback issue and the Windows AI backend connectivity issue! 🎉
